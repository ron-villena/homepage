            <h2 class="text-center">What is important?</h2>
            <p class="text-center">Being a supportive, loyal, interesting and (most important) loving husband. Being a father my kids can look up to, can seek advice, can trust, can depend upon, can love and be loved and can laugh (both ways). If you are my friend, I will be there for you; if you are my close friend, I will always, always be there for you. Get the job done.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">What is needed?</h2>
            <p class="text-center">Honesty is always the best policy. If I'm working with you or for you, we will fight to get it done right. Not everyone is a superstar (I'll be the first to admit that), but as long as you put in the work, I will always be right therre for you and with you. Fight, Fight, Fight - Never give up. Love, Live, Appreciate and Laugh!!!</p>
